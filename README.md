# GrothendieckLimitShapes
Code for drawing limit shapes of Grothendieck random partitions, based on the joint work of S. Gavrilova and L. Petrov (2023)


# Usage

```
python3 Code.py
```

All parameters are hardcoded into the file. Note the special issues when all roots are real, we need to take the correct roots to be able to get the correct limit shape.

# Reference

We used the cubic equation solver from [here](https://github.com/shril/CubicEquationSolver/tree/master)

# Examples

With parameters xpar, ypar, beta = 1/3.0, 1/5.0, -6.0
